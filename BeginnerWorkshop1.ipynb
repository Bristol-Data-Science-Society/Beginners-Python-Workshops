    "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Interpreted means the code is transformed into machine code and executed one line at a time, high-level means the code we write is far removed from the machine code, or alternatively we are very close to natural language, general purpose means it can be used for a wide variety of things, as opposed to just a few specialised problems. It was released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and focuses on code readability, that is to say making it easy to understand what a block of code does just by looking at it. Python's name is derived from the comedy group Monty Python, which Guido was very fond of."
